# Arduino + I2C LCD Framework

Developed for Ardunio Nano (ATmega328P)

## Setup

 1. `brew install platformio`
 2. `pio run -e development` will build and run the native build in your terminal
 3. To run the native build, the executable is `./.pio/build/development/program`

## Future work

 - Make this run on an arduino (should need to implement the Lcd interface but otherwise it shouldn't be too bad)
